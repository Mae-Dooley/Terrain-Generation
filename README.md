# Terrain-Generation
Generating 3D terrain using Perlin Noise in Unity

This project was really fun and taught me a lot about how to work with meshes in Unity. 
The tutorial series by Sebastian Lague: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0eBW2EiBtl_sxmDtSgZBxB3 was extremely valuable in learning about meshes. 
From this I would like to make a terrain mesh editor that reacts in real time to variable changes. I would also like to combine this code with my flocking simulation to create a bird watching demo.
